In this process, we make \"\"infinite use of finite means\"\", enabling us to learn new concepts quickly and nest concepts within each-other. While program induction and synthesis remain at the heart of foundational theories of artificial intelligence, only recently has the community moved forward in attempting to use program learning as a benchmark task itself. The cognitive science community has thus often assumed that if the brain has simulation and reasoning capabilities equivalent to a universal computer, then it must employ a serialized, symbolic representation. Here we confront that assumption, and provide a counterexample in which compositionality is expressed via network structure: the free category prior over programs. We show how our formalism allows neural networks to serve as primitives in probabilistic programs. We learn both program structure and model parameters end-to-end. \"\t\"@article{sennesh2020learning,\n",

Recent work increasingly suggests that the common practice of averaging across participants and stimuli leaves out systematic and meaningful information. We propose Neural Topographic Factor Analysis (NTFA), a probabilistic factor analysis model that infers embeddings for participants and stimuli. These embeddings allow us to reason about differences between participants and stimuli as signal rather than noise. We evaluate NTFA on data from an in-house pilot experiment, as well as two publicly available datasets. We demonstrate that inferring representations for participants and stimuli improves predictive generalization to unseen data when compared to previous topographic methods. We also demonstrate that the inferred latent factor representations are useful for downstream tasks such as multivoxel pattern analysis and functional connectivity.\t\"@inproceedings{NEURIPS2020_8c3c27ac,\n",

      "2021-12-20\tInteroception as modeling, allostasis as control\tBiological Psychology\tThe brain regulates the body by anticipating its needs and attempting to meet them before they arise – a process called allostasis. Allostasis requires a model of the changing sensory conditions within the body, a process called interoception. In this paper, we examine how interoception may provide performance feedback for allostasis. We suggest studying allostasis in terms of control theory, reviewing control theory’s applications to related issues in physiology, motor control, and decision making. We synthesize these by relating them to the important properties of allostatic regulation as a control problem. We then sketch a novel formalism for how the brain might perform allostatic control of the viscera by analogy to skeletomotor control, including a mathematical view on how interoception acts as performance feedback for allostasis. Finally, we suggest ways to test implications of our hypotheses.\t\"@article{sennesh2022interoception,\n",

Despite the ubiquity of the phenomenon, traditional analytical tools for modeling degeneracy in neuroscience are extremely limited. In this study, we generated synthetic datasets to describe three situations of degeneracy in fMRI data to demonstrate the limitations of the current univariate approach. We describe a novel computational approach for the analysis referred to as neural topographic factor analysis (NTFA). NTFA is designed to capture variations in neural activity across task conditions and participants. The advantage of this discovery-oriented approach is to reveal whether and how experimental trials and participants cluster into task conditions and participant groups. We applied NTFA on simulated data, revealing the appropriate degeneracy assumption …\t\"@article{khan2022computational,\n",

      "2022-05-09\tA Probabilistic Generative Model of Free Categories\tarxiv\tApplied category theory has recently developed libraries for computing with morphisms in interesting categories, while machine learning has developed ways of learning programs in interesting languages. Taking the analogy between categories and languages seriously, this paper defines a probabilistic generative model of morphisms in free monoidal categories over domain-specific generating objects and morphisms. The paper shows how acyclic directed wiring diagrams can model specifications for morphisms, which the model can use to generate morphisms. Amortized variational inference in the generative model then enables learning of parameters (by maximum likelihood) and inference of latent variables (by Bayesian inversion). A concrete experiment shows that the free category prior achieves competitive reconstruction performance on the Omniglot dataset.\t\"@article{sennesh2022probabilistic,\n",
