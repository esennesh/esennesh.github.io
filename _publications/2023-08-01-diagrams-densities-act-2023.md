A growing body of research on probabilistic programs and causal models has highlighted the need
to reason compositionally about model classes that extend directed graphical models. Both proba-
bilistic programs and causal models define a joint probability density over a set of random variables,
and exhibit sparse structure that can be used to reason about causation and conditional independence.
This work builds on recent work on Markov categories of probabilistic mappings to define a category
whose morphisms combine a joint density, factorized over each sample space, with a determinis-
tic mapping from samples to return values. This is a step towards closing the gap between recent
category-theoretic descriptions of probability measures, and the operational definitions of factorized
densities that are commonly employed in probabilistic programming and causal inference.
