Category theory has been successfully applied in various domains of science, shedding light on universal principles unifying diverse phenomena and thereby enabling knowledge transfer between them. Applications to machine learning have been pursued recently, and yet there is still a gap between abstract mathematical foundations and concrete applications to machine learning tasks. In this paper we introduce DisCoPyro as a categorical structure learning framework, which combines categorical structures (such as symmetric monoidal categories and operads) with amortized variational inference, and can be applied, e.g., in program learning for variational autoencoders. We provide both mathematical foundations and concrete applications together with comparison of experimental performance with other models (e.g., neuro-symbolic models). We speculate that DisCoPyro could ultimately contribute to the development of artificial general intelligence.
