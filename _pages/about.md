It is well known that human beings do not receive concrete “juice rewards” for abstract decisions such as their votes in elections. Yet somehow, despite a lack of immediate pleasure or pain, we all form emotionally weighty opinions about everything ranging from breakfast foods to the course of history—so much so that we cannot predict events without accounting for our opinions. How does it happen? Much recent research in the cognitive sciences has put forth a paradigm that grips me: a science to weave together sensorimotor signals into perception, knowledge, affect, and action. I believe that these latter aspects of affect and evaluation should be taken seriously in order to explain the enigmas of motivation, intention, and motor action. By pursuing a research PhD and onward into an academic career, I am eager to join the efforts to combine computational models with neuroscientific evidence to investigate how the (literal) brain brings the (metaphorical) heart into being.

At Northeastern’s Interdisciplinary Affective Processing Lab, I can do just that. I am excited to see that the Lab is now bringing the study of emotion and motivation around from a “classical view” (with a fixed palette of emotion categories), to a “constructive” view (based in embodied predictive processing). This is exactly the paradigm within which I hope to work, and exactly the topic in which I hope to specialize. The Lab’s wide variety of experimental methods–neuroimaging, brain stimulation, and behavioral studies considered collectively–can provide me with excellent training opportunities for doing neuroscientific work. Additionally, my quantitative background can help in refining mathematical and computational models of the Lab’s theory of constructed emotion. Above all, the Lab’s current shift from the classical view to the constructionist view presents an ideal opportunity for me to investigate the enactment of emotion, and the role of intention in generating both emotional enactment and outwardly-visible action.
