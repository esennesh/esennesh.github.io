What gets you out of bed in the morning? Everything we do in life has a cost to
our [body budget](https://news.northeastern.edu/2020/12/01/your-brain-is-the-worlds-most-proficient-accountant-heres-how/),
and yet we do so much more with our lives than survive as minimally as possible.
Is that just a trick of evolutionary accident, or do our feelings arise from more
than the minimization of deficits?  Our situations change moment to moment, and ensuring our
well-being across those changes requires [*predictive regulation*: allostasis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051121002350).

In every moment, our brains need to infer, from nothing but experience and sensorimotor
data: who am I, how do I feel, what's going on, and what can I do about it? Solving
this problem requires the brain to build a generative model
of the body and world, fit that model by predictive coding,
and [infer](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v161/stites21a.html) beliefs about the unobserved
components of that model.

I am in the 5th year of my PhD at Northeastern University.
I work in the [Probabilistic Modeling Lab](https://jwvdm.github.io/) with Jan-Willem van
de Meent and the [Interdisciplinary Affective Science Lab](https://affective-science.org)
with Lisa Feldman Barrett and Karen Quigley. In the former I address efficient inference in [generative
models for neuroscience](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/8c3c27ac7d298331a1bdfd0a5e8703d3-Abstract.html) and related domains. In the latter I ask how interoception, the internal
sense of the body, constrains action and the concepts constructed to reuse actions.

$$\tilde{\mathcal{V}}^{*}_{\theta,\phi} = \mathbb{E}_{q_{\phi}(\mathbf{x}_{1:T} \mid \mathbf{x}_{0})} \left[ \sum_{t=1}^{T} J(\mathbf{x}_{t}, \mathbf{x}_{t+1}) - \mu \right] \leq \tilde{V}^{*}(\mathbf{x}_{0})$$
