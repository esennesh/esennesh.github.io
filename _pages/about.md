What gets you out of bed in the morning?  Are our feelings really just a bag of
irrational tricks thrown together by evolutionary accident, or are there real
reasons for us to act as we do?  How does 1.4kg of spongy meat trapped in a big
white bone help us live proactively as individuals with meaningful lives?

Neuroscience is coming to view the brain not as a passive organ of intellect,
derailed by emotional spasms, but as a proactive organ of feeling, action, and
causation.  Your situation changes moment to moment, and ensuring your
well-being across those changes requires *predictive regulation*.  In every
moment, your brain needs to infer, from nothing but experience and sensorimotor
data: who am I, how do I feel, what's going on, and what can I do about it?

To do so, the feeling brain implements some of the finest intellectual
instruments of thought we have today: hierarchical probabilistic inference,
causal learning, and active inference.  I therefore see probability and
information as fundamental to what life is: coffee cups cooling, evolution,
embodied feeling, intellect, and agency may all have to obey probabilistic laws.

To pursue these ideas, I work in the Probabilistic Modeling Lab at
Northeastern University's CCIS, as well as the [Interdisciplinary Affective Science Laboratory](https://affective-science.org).
We use the tools of machine learning, statistics, and computation to study the
deep questions at the heart of neuroscience, cognition, and agency.  Potential
applications range from [building machines that feel, value, and engage the world like people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvMnG07n2do), to [computational
psychiatry](http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/early/2015/07/08/jnnp-2015-310737?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=JNNP_TrendMD-0), to [philosophical issues](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1754073916670021).

$$p = arg\,max_{p}\,H\left(Q\right) + -H_{Q(s; p, a)}\left[P(s, a, w)\right]$$
$$p = arg\,max_{p}\,Simplicity+Accuracy$$
$$a = arg\,max_{a}\,H\left(Q\right) + -H_{Q(s; p, a)}\left[U(s, a, w)\right]$$
$$a = arg\,min_{a}\,Exploration+Exploitation$$
